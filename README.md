# CSC 436 Task6
Start from https://github.com/matgargano/classwork-20230308

Finish up the Book component. Make the proper request to the book API, e.g., https://api.matgargano.com/api/books/1003, and output the individual book data.

I will be giving points for creativity
Make sure there is an easy way to return to the books listing page (breadcrumb?)
Extra credit if you can write your own hook that will both abstract and handle the obtention of the data and expose the data, loading state, error state. Then refactor “Books” to use that same hook.
